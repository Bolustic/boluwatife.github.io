# Project 1

**Title:** [IncomeÂ Distribution by Socioeconomic Factors](https://github.com/Bolustic/boluwatife.github.io/blob/main/Socioeconomic%20Factors%20and%20Income%20Dataset.xlsx)


**Dashboard Overview:**
![SocialEcoe](SocialEcoe.JPG)

**Tools Used:** Microsoft Excel (Pivot Chart, Pivot Table, Conditional Formatting, Slicer)


**Project Description:** 

This dataset contains demographic and socioeconomic information for 2000 individuals, including attributes such as age, education level, occupation, income, and settlement size. It is ideal for studies related to income distribution, employment trends, and socioeconomic factors influencing financial status.

The dataset includes the following columns:

ID: Unique identifier for each individual

Sex: Encoded as 0 (Female) and 1 (Male)

Marital Status: Categorized as single or non-single (divorced/separated/married/widowed)

Age: Age of the individual

Education: Education level attained (e.g., high school, university)

Income: Annual income in monetary units

Occupation: Job classification (e.g., skilled employee, unemployed)

Settlement Size: Categorization of the residential area (possibly urban/rural classification)


**Key findings:** 

Income Prediction: Understanding how factors like education, marital status, age group, and occupation impact earnings

Demographic & Socioeconomic Analysis: Exploring relationships between age, settlement type, and economic well-being




# Project 2

**Title:** Employee Queries, Interrogation, and Manipulation

**SQL Code:** [Employee SQL Code](https://github.com/Bolustic/boluwatife.github.io/blob/main/Employee.SQL)

**SQL Skills Used:**
Data Retrieval (SELECT): Queried and extracted specific information from the database.
Data Aggregation (SUM, COUNT): Calculated totals, such as sales and quantities, and counted records to analyze data trends.
Data Filtering (WHERE, BETWEEN, IN, AND): Applied filters to select relevant data, including filtering by ranges and lists.
Data Source Specification (FROM): Specified the tables used as data sources for retrieval

**Project Description:**
This project focuses on the analysis of a comprehensive dataset containing detailed information about approximately 11,000 football players. The primary objective is to utilize SQL for extracting meaningful insights regarding player demographics, performance metrics, and other relevant attributes.
Database Design and Implementation: Develop a relational database schema to effectively store and manage the football players' data, ensuring normalization and referential integrity.
Data Analysis Using SQL: Execute SQL queries to analyze various aspects of the dataset, including: Player demographics (e.g., age, nationality). Performance metrics (e.g., ratings, positions). Financial attributes (e.g., wages, market value).
Insight Extraction: Identify patterns and trends within the data, such as: Nationalities with the highest representation among players. Correlation between player attributes and performance metrics. Distribution of players across different clubs and leagues.
Reporting and Visualization: Present the findings through comprehensive reports and visualizations to facilitate better understanding and decision-making. By the end of this project, we aim to have a fully functional SQL database capable of providing in-depth analysis of football players' data, offering valuable insights for stakeholders such as team managers, scouts, and analysts
 
**Technology used:** SQL server
